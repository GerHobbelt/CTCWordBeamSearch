# CTC Word Beam Search Decoding Algorithm

**CTC decoder with dictionary and language model for TensorFlow | C++ implementation | Python implementation**

## About this fork
The original is by @githubharald. This fork is a slight modification incorporating the following changes:

* In addition to the top decodings of the batch, the module op returns the score vector (a sequence probability) for each best decoding
* Like the corresponding `tf.nn.ctc_beam_search_decoder`, the module op requires the sequence length for every batch element (preventing wasted computation and invalid decodings)
* Adds tensor shape inference code (much like `tf.nn.ctc_beam_search_decoder`) for convenience

## A First Example

The following code-skeleton gives a first impression of how to use the decoding algorithm with TensorFlow.
More details can be found in the Usage section. 

```python
# load compiled custom operation
module=tf.load_op_library('TFWordBeamSearch.so') 

# decode mat using automatically created dictionary and language model
# corpus, chars, wordChars are (UTF8 encoded) strings
# mat is a tensor (shape TxBxC) and seqLen is a vector (Bx1) with values in [0,T]
beamWidth=25
lmType='NGrams'
lmSmoothing=0.01
decode=module.word_beam_search(mat, seqLen, beamWidth, lmType, lmSmoothing, corpus, chars, wordChars) 

# feed matrix (TxBxC), sequence lengths (Bx1), evaluate and output decoded text (BxT) and score (Bx1)
decoded,score=sess.run(decode, { mat:feedMat, seqlen:feedSeqlen }) 
```


## Introduction

Word beam search decoding is a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) decoding algorithm.
It is used for sequence recognition tasks like Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) or Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR).
The following illustration shows a HTR system with its Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) layers, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) layers and the final CTC (loss and decoding) layer.
Word beam search decoding is placed right after the RNN layers to decode the output, see the red dashed rectangle in the illustration.

## Algorithm

The four main properties of word beam search are:

* Words constrained by dictionary
* Allows arbitrary number of non-word characters between words (numbers, punctuation marks)
* Optional word-level Language Model (LM)
* Faster than token passing

The following sample shows a typical use-case of word beam search along with the results given by five different decoders.
Best path decoding and vanilla beam search get the words wrong as these decoders only use the noisy output of the optical model.
Extending vanilla beam search by a character-level LM improves the result by only allowing likely character sequences.
Token passing uses a dictionary and a word-level LM and therefore gets all words right.
However, it is not able to recognize arbitrary character strings like numbers.
Word beam search is able to recognize the words by using a dictionary, but it is also able to correctly identify the non-word characters.

This algorithm is well suited when a large amount of words to be recognized is known in advance.
An overview of the inputs and the output of the algorithm is given in the illustration below.
The RNN output is fed into the algorithm.
Textual input enables word beam search decoding to create a dictionary and LM.
Different settings control how the LM scores the beams (text candidates) and how many beams are kept per time-step.
The algorithm outputs the decoded text.

## Usage

This section explains how to compile the TensorFlow custom operation, how to test it and how to use it. 
The C++ code can also be compiled into an executable.
Further, a prototype of the algorithm is implemented in Python without any dependency to TensorFlow.

### TensorFlow Custom Operation

#### 1. Compile

Go to the ```cpp/proj/``` directory and run the script ```./buildTF.sh```.
If you want to split the decoding of a batch among multiple threads, add the command line parameters ```PARALLEL NUM_THREADS```, e.g. ```./buildTF.sh PARALLEL 8``` to use 8 threads.
Best performance if achieved when the number of threads equals the number of cores on your CPU.
The script creates a library object (Linux only, tested with Ubuntu 16.04, g++ 5.4.0 and TensorFlow 1.3.0, 1.4.0, 1.5.0 and 1.6.0).
For more information see [TensorFlow documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/extend/adding_an_op).

#### 2. Test Custom Operation

Then go to the ```tf/``` directory and run the script ```python testCustomOp.py```.
The expected output is as follows:

```text
Mini example:
Label string:  [1 0 3]
Char string: "ba"

Real example:
Label string:  [76 78 59 70 66 77 77  0 59 72 77 65  0 70 62 71 77 58 69  0 58 71 61  0 60
 72 75 73 72 75 62 58 69 10  0 66 76  0 63 58 75  0 59 62 82 72 71 61  0 58
 71 82  0 66 61 62 58 93 93 93 93 93 93 93 93 93 93 93 93 93 93 93 93 93 93
 93 93 93 93 93 93 93 93 93 93 93 93 93 93 93 93 93 93 93 93 93 93 93 93 93]
Char string: "submitt both mental and corporeal, is far beyond any idea"
```

#### 3. Add to your TensorFlow Model

The script ```tf/testCustomOp.py``` is fully documented.
A high-level overview of the inputs and output was already given.
Here follows a more technical discussion.
The interface of the operation is: ```word_beam_search(mat, beamWidth, lmType, lmSmoothing, corpus, chars, wordChars)```.
Some notes regarding the input parameters:

* Input matrix (mat): is expected to have shape TxBx(C+1) with the **softmax-function already applied** (in contrast to the TensorFlow operations ctc_greedy_decoder and ctc_beam_search_decoder!). The CTC-blank must be the last entry in the matrix
* Beam Width (beamWidth): number of beams which are kept per time-step
* Scoring mode (lmType): pass one of the four strings (not case-sensitive). The running time with respect to the dictionary size W is given.
    * "Words": only use dictionary, no scoring: O(1)
    * "NGrams": use dictionary and score beams with LM: O(log(W))
    * "NGramsForecast": forecast (possible) next words and apply LM to these words: O(W*log(W))
    * "NGramsForecastAndSample": restrict number of (possible) next words to at most 20 words: O(W)
* Smoothing (lmSmoothing): LM uses add-k smoothing to allow word pairs which are not known from the training text, i.e. for which the bigram probability is zero. Set to values between 0 and 1, e.g. 0.01. To disable smoothing, set to 0
* Text (corpus): is given as a UTF8 encoded string. The operation creates its dictionary and (optionally) LM from it
* Characters (chars): must be given as a UTF8 encoded string. If the number of characters is C, then the RNN output must have the size TxBx(C+1) with the last entry representing the CTC-blank label. The ordering of the characters must correspond to the ordering in the RNN output, e.g. if the RNN outputs the probabilities for "a", "b", " " and CTC-blank in this order, then the string "ab " must be passed
* Word characters (wordChars): define how the algorithm extracts words from the text. Must be passed as a UTF8 encoded string. If the word characters are "ab", and the text "aa ab bbb a" is passed, then the words "aa", "ab" and "bbb" will be extracted and used for the dictionary and the LM. Of course, the word characters must be a subset of the characters recognized by the RNN and 0<len(wordChars)<len(chars)


This code snippet shows how to load the custom operation and how to use it.

```python
# the RNN output has one additional character (the CTC-blank)
assert(len(chars)+1==mat.shape[2])

# load custom TF operation
word_beam_search_module=tf.load_op_library('../cpp/proj/TFWordBeamSearch.so')

# decode using the "Words" mode of word beam search
decode=word_beam_search_module.word_beam_search(mat, seqLen, 25, 'Words', 0.0, corpus.encode('utf8'), chars.encode('utf8'), wordChars.encode('utf8'))

# feed matrix of shape TxBxC and evaluate TF graph
decoded,score=sess.run(decode, { mat:feedMat, seqLen:feedSeqLen })
```

The output of the algorithm has shape BxT. 
The **label strings** are **terminated by a CTC-blank** if the length is smaller than T, similar as a C string (in contrast to the TensorFlow operations ctc_greedy_decoder and ctc_beam_search_decoder which use a SparseTensor!).
The following illustration shows an output with B=3 and T=5. 
"-" represents the CTC-blank label.

![output](./doc/output.png)

The following code snippet shows how to get the label string of the first batch element and how to transform it into a character string.

```python
blank=len(chars)
s=''
batch=0
for label in res[batch]:
	if label==blank:
		break
	s+=chars[label]
```
